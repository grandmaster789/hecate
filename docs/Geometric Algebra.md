This seems to be somewhat of a popular subject in academic circles, especially for physicists. A lot of geometric operations become a bunch more straightforward when expressed in geometric algebra, and this becomes especially handy when calculating intersections and doing things like inverse kinematics.

I get the sense that this may be an important development, but large-scale adoption is still lagging behind. The theory itself has been around for ages.
